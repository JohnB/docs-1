# Getting started with pipelines as code

- two options for creating a pipeline, in the UI or using a `pipeline.yml` file
- this guide will introduce `pipeline.yml` files, and step through how to write them

## What are `pipeline.yml` files

- files that describe your build steps in yaml
- are stored in your repository and versioned alongside your code
- they give you more fine-grained control over what happens in your pipeline
- more advanced pipelines can be autogenerated by a script

- rather than describing each step in your pipeline using the buildkite.com UI, you only need to describe one step that uploads your `pipeline.yml` file
- the yaml file is interpreted by the Buildkite Agent that runs the upload job, and your steps are added to your pipeline at runtime 

## Writing a `pipeline.yml` file

- create a file called `pipeline.yml` in a new folder called `.buildkite`

## Using a `pipeline.yml` file

- to use your `pipeline.yml` file in a pipeline, you first need to set it up in buildkite.com
- create a new pipeline with your repo that contains your `pipeline.yml` file
- create a command step in your pipeline that runs the upload command:
`buildkite-agent upload pipeline.yml`
